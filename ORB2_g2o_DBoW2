DBoW2 and g2o (Included in Thirdparty folder)
We use modified versions of the DBoW2 library to perform place recognition and g2o library to perform non-linear optimizations.
Both modified libraries (which are BSD) are included in the Thirdparty folder.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2.git ORB_SLAM2

We provide a script build.sh to build the Thirdparty libraries and ORB-SLAM2. Please make sure you have installed 
all required dependencies (see section 2). Execute:

cd ORB_SLAM2
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
